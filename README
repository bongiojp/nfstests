Tests are run through Makefile. Each directory relates to one rule in the Makefile.

There are four environment required by the tests:

SERVER - hostname or ip of the nfs server

EXPORTDIR - The directory that is being shared (exported) by nfs

TMPDIR - Where output files from tests should go. These will eventually be parsed and turned into junit xml files.

XMLDEST - Where the junit xml files should be placed.


An example run on my local virtual machine:
SERVER=192.168.122.101 EXPORTDIR=/mnt/temp XMLDEST=/opt/xml TMPDIR=/tmp make
