Various tests to make sure NFSv4 locking is working properly.

* shared and exclusive locks
* multiple files locked by a single client
* multiple opens and closes before any locking operations.
* TEST with a lock owner (a separate process already has a lock) before any lock requests.
* Unlocking bytes in the middle of a big lock, effectively splitting it in two ... hopefully.
