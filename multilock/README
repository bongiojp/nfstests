multilock test tool

OVERVIEW
--------

Multilock is a test tool for testing functionality of POSIX locks. It is
directed at testing NFS server and client implementations. The architecture of
the tool is a master program (ml_master) and child programs (currently 
ml_posix_chold). The master directs any number of children in a sequence of
lock operations. The communication between the master and children is a TCP
connection, so the children may be run on multiple hosts (for example, multiple
clients of the same NFS server, or even a local process on the NFS server
itself). Other remote file system protocols may also be tested (any remote
file system that can be mounted on Linux and provides byte range locks via
POSIX fcntl may be exercised using ml_posix_child).

The communication protocol with the children is documented below so additional
children may be implemented to implement other OS flavors (such as Windows), or
even directly drive protocols (such as NFS v3/NLM, NFS v4, or CIFS/Samba).

The child programs are reasonably capable of being run using ssh which allows
them to be used by an automated test case.

ml_posix_child is also capable of being run standalone (the protocol used over
TCP is plain text so it is trivial to read input from stdin instead of a TCP
socket).

EXECUTING THE PROGRAMS
----------------------

ml_master
---------

ml_master has two modes, scripted and interractive. Several command line options
allow some control over output and how errors are handled.

Usage: ml_master [-p port] [-s] [-f] [-q] [-x script] [-d]

  -p port   - specify the port to listen to children on
  -s        - specify strict mode (children are not polled without EXPECT)
  -f        - specify errors are fatal mode
  -q        - speficy quiet mode
  -d        - speficy dup errors mode (errors are sent to stdout and stderr)
  -x script - specify script to run
  -k        - syntax check only
  -e        - non-fatal errors, full accounting of errors to stderr, everything to stdout

Since there is no method of automatic port discovery, the -p option is
reccomended so that the children can be told which port to contact the
server on.

The -k option when combined with -x to specify a script will result in
the script just being syntax checked. Whenever a script is specified, it is
completely syntax checked before the master starts up and runs the script.

The -e option results in stderr showing the command leading to the failure,
the expected output, and the actual response. This is useful for reporting
problems. The -e option also duplicates stderr to stdout just as per -d.

ml_posix_child
--------------

ml_posix_child has three modes, interractive (standalone), scripted
(standalone), and master. There is almost no difference between scripted mode
and interracive mode where a stdin is redirected from a file.

Usage: ml_posix_child -s server -p port -n name [-q] [-d] [-c path]
       ml_posix_child -x script [-q] [-d] [-c path]
       ml_posix_child [-q] [-d] [-c path]

  ml_posix_child may be run in three modes
  - In the first mode, the child will be driven by a master.
  - In the second mode, the child is driven by a script.
  - In the third mode, the child interractive.

  -s server - specify the master's hostname or IP address
  -p port   - specify the master's port number
  -n name   - specify the child's name
  -x script - specify the name of a script to execute
  -q        - specify quiet mode
  -d        - specify dup errors mode (errors are sent to stdout and stderr)
  -c path   - chdir

In master mode, the server's address and port must be specified. Also the
child must be given a name (which the master will use to identify which
child commands are intended for and from which responses are expected).

The -c option allows the child to execute in a specific directory. This
would allow a test client machine to have several different mounts to the
same server using different protocols and have the script executed from the
master easily direct testing to any of those mounts without the script needing
to be modified (for example, the script can just refer to files by file name
without any path).

THE COMMAND PROTOCOL
--------------------

The following documents the protocol the master uses to send commands to the
child. Since this is a plain text protocol, it is also the command language of
the children in interractive mode. Note that the master doesn't necessarily
utilize all the flexibility of this protocol (for example, the master will
always tag commands, and will always quote strings).

Note that the protocol is almost exclusively case insensitive (except for
strings).

Strings that are at the end of a command need not be quoted. Any leading
blanks will not be part of the string. Strings must be quoted if they
might be mistaken for an optional parameter.

Strings currently can not contain new-line characters.

The general format of a command is:

[tag] command parameters

Commands are terminated with a new-line.

The tag is a numeric label for the command. The purpose of the tag is to
allow the master to correlate responses with specific commands for
verification.

The commands and specific parameters are:

[tag] OPEN    file_pos rw|ro|wo|O_RDWR|O_RDONLY|O_WRONLY [create|creat|O_CREAT] "file-name"
[tag] CLOSE   file_pos
[tag] READ    file_pos length
[tag] READ    file_pos "string"
[tag] WRITE   file_pos "data"
[tag] SEEK    file_pos offset
[tag] LOCK    file_pos read|write|shared|exclusive|F_RDLCK|F_WRLCK start length
[tag] LOCKW   file_pos read|write|shared|exclusive|F_RDLCK|F_WRLCK start length
[tag] UNLOCK  file_pos start length
[tag] TEST    file_pos read|write|shared|exclusive|F_RDLCK|F_WRLCK start length
[tag] LIST    file_pos start length
[tag] HOP     file_pos read|write|shared|exclusive|F_RDLCK|F_WRLCK start length
[tag] UNHOP   file_pos start length
[tag] COMMENT "string"
[tag] HELLO   "name"
[tag] ALARM   seconds
[tag] QUIT

OPEN
----

The child maintains an array of file references, file_pos specifies which entry
is to be used to reference the file for other commands. It operates much like
a file descriptor.

Files may be opened read-write, read-only, or write-only. Files may also be
created on open (other open flags may be supported in the future).

CLOSE
-----

Closes a file and frees the file_pos for re-use.

READ
----

Read data from the current position in the file (use SEEK to set the position).

This is fundamentally a record read, though the record contents are expected
to be ascii strings.

If the second form of the command is given, the length of the string is
used as the read length (this form is to be used with master scripting command
OK).

WRITE
-----

Write the string to the current position in the file (use SEEK to set the
position).

This is fundamentally a record write, though the record contents are expected
to be ascii strings.

SEEK
----

Seek will set the current file position. Use this to select the record to
read or write.

LOCK
----

Lock requests a non-blocking lock. If the lock can not be granted, the command
will return immediately with DENIED status. Locks may be read or write locks 
(aka shared or exclusive).

LOCKW
-----

LockW requests a blocking lock. If the lock can not be immediately granted, the
command will block. Locks may be read or write locks (aka shared or exclusive).

Implementation Note: ml_posix_child sets a default alarm of 5 seconds before
this command if an alarm isn't already set. This will prevent script hangs if
a lock will never be granted. If a script expects a longer delay, it should
set an explicit alarm.

TEST
----

Test will test for lock conflict, and if a lock conflict is found, details of a
conflicting lock will be returned. Locks may be read or write locks
(aka shared or exclusive).

LIST
----

List will return a list of locks overlapping the range specified. The
expectation is that effectively a series of TEST operations for write locks will
will be used to discover the list of locks.

COMMENT
-------

Comment is a do nothing command. It allows the master to send some commentary to
the children.

HELLO
-----

This is another do nothing command. It's real purpose is a response place holder 
for the master to be able to receive initial "HELLO" communications from the
children.

ALARM
-----

Alarm is used to set an alarm, it may interrupt a blocked lock (which in fact is
it's primary purpose). If an alarm is already running, the existing alarm will
be cancelled and a new alarm set. A seconds value of 0 will cancel any existing
alarm and not set a new one.

QUIT
----

Quit instructs a child to release all locks, close all files, and exit.

THE RESPONSE PROTOCOL
---------------------

The following documents the protocol the children uses to send responses to the
master. Note that the children don't utilize all the flexibility of this
protocol (for example, ml_posix_child will always quote strings).

Note that the protocol is almost exclusively case insensitive (except for
strings).

Strings that are at the end of a response need not be quoted. Any leading
blanks will not be part of the string. Strings must be quoted if they
might be mistaken for an optional parameter.

Strings currently can not contain new-line characters.

The general format is:

tag COMMAND STATUS results

The specific responses are:

tag OPEN    OK file_pos file_number
tag CLOSE   OK file_pos
tag READ    OK file_pos length "data"
tag WRITE   OK file_pos length
tag SEEK    OK file_pos
tag LOCK    GRANTED   file_pos read|write|shared|exclusive|F_RDLCK|F_WRLCK start length
tag LOCK    DENIED    file_pos read|write|shared|exclusive|F_RDLCK|F_WRLCK start length
tag LOCKW   GRANTED   file_pos read|write|shared|exclusive|F_RDLCK|F_WRLCK start length
tag LOCKW   CANCELED  file_pos read|write|shared|exclusive|F_RDLCK|F_WRLCK start length
tag LOCKW   DEADLOCK  file_pos read|write|shared|exclusive|F_RDLCK|F_WRLCK start length
tag UNLOCK  GRANTED   file_pos unlock|F_UNLCK start length
tag TEST    AVAILABLE file_pos read|write|shared|exclusive|F_RDLCK|F_WRLCK start length
tag TEST    CONFLICT  file_pos pid read|write|shared|exclusive|F_RDLCK|F_WRLCK start length
tag LIST    AVAILABLE file_pos start length
tag LIST    DENIED    file_pos start length
tag LIST    CONFLICT  file_pos pid read|write|shared|exclusive|F_RDLCK|F_WRLCK start length
tag HOP     GRANTED   file_pos read|write|shared|exclusive|F_RDLCK|F_WRLCK start length
tag HOP     DENIED    file_pos read|write|shared|exclusive|F_RDLCK|F_WRLCK start length
tag UNHOP   GRANTED   file_pos unlock|F_UNLCK start length
tag COMMENT OK "string"
tag HELLO   OK "name"
tag ALARM   OK seconds
tag ALARM   CANCELED remain
tag ALARM   COMPLETED
tag QUIT    OK
tag cmd     ERRNO value "string"

If a command results in an error, an errno and description of the error will be
returned in the response. Currently ml_master doesn't really do anything to
analyze these errors. They will cause failure of scripts of course.

OPEN
----

Returns OK or ERRNO. A successful OPEN will respond with the file number that
results from opening the file. This should not be relied on to be any specific 
value and is merely provided for edification.

CLOSE
-----

Returns OK or ERRNO.

READ
----

Returns OK or ERRNO. If successful, the length of data read and the actual
data will be returned.

WRITE
-----

Returns OK or ERRNO. If successful, the actual length of data written wil be
returned.

SEEK
----

Returns OK or ERRNO.

LOCK
----

Returns GRANTED, DENIED, or ERRNO.

LOCKW
-----

Returns GRANTED, CANCELED, DEADLOCK, or ERRNO. If a blocked lock is canceled
(for example by an alarm triggering), the CANCELED status will be returned.
If a deadlock is detected, DEADLOCK will be returned.

UNLOCK
------

Returns GRANTED or ERRNO.

TEST
----

Returns AVAILABLE, CONLFICT or ERRNO. If there is a conflicting lock, one
conflicting lock will be returned.

LIST
----

Returns AVAILABLE, DENIED or ERRNO. Prior to returning DENIED, a list will
return one or more CONFLICT responses corresponding to locks held that overlap
the range. An AVAILABLE response indicates an empty list while a DENIED response
indicates no more CONFLICT responses are forthcoming.

It should be noted that LIST will only be able to return one instance of a read
lock if there are multiple read locks on the same range. LIST may or may not
return two read locks if there is one read lock and a second larger read lock
that completely overlaps the first one. LIST should return two read locks if
they partially overlap.

For example:

owner1 read 1-3, owner2 read 1-3, owner3 read 1-3 can only return one of those.

onwer1 read 1-3, owner2 read 1-6 may return just owner2 read 1-6 or both.

owner1 read 1-6, owner2 read 3-9 should return both.

This is due to how fcntl with F_GETLK is implemented (or NFS v3 TEST or NFS v4
LOCKT).

HOP
---

Returns GRANTED, DENIED, or ERRNO.

HOP is similar to LOCK, except the lock is acquired one byte at a time in an
alternating pattern (for example, HOP read 0 5 is acquired in order 0, 2, 1, 4,
3).

UNHOP
-----

Returns GRANTED or ERRNO.

UNHOP is similar to UNLOCK, except the lock is released one byte at a time in an
alternating pattern (for example, UNHOP 0 5 is released in order 0, 2, 1, 4, 3).

COMMENT
-------

Returns OK and reflects back the original comment.

HELLO
-----

Returns OK and reflects back the original comment. Children are expected to send
a HELLO response to identify themselves when first connecting to the master.

ALARM
-----

Returns OK and CANCELED or COMPLETE. If the alarm is canceled before completion,
a CANCELED response will be sent. If the alarm triggers, a COMPLETE response
will be sent.

QUIT
----

Returns OK. A child should response to QUIT before closing the connection
with the master.

MASTER SCRIPTING
----------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The master implements a simple script language which allows commands to be
directed to multiple children. The scripting language also allows for
verification of child responses.

The master script commands are:

#
QUIT
STRICT    on|off
FATAL     on|off
SLEEP     seconds
name      tag command parameters
EXPECT    name tag command results
OK        name command parameters
GRANTED   name command parameters
AVAILABLE name command parameters
DENIED    name command parameters
DEADLOCK  name command parameters
CHILDREN  name name...
{
}

There are some special tag values that may be used. $ references the line number
of a command. When used in an EXPECT, it uses the line number of the last
command. $A to $Z increment the variable when used in a command, and store the
tag into a slot. When used in an EXPECT, $A to $Z use the value out of the slot.
This simplifies script writing while still allowing responses to be correlated
with earlier commands (for example a LOCK, LOCKW (blocks), UNLOCK, GRANTED
sequence).

#
-

This allows comments to be placed in scripts.

QUIT
----

This ends a script. QUIT will be sent to each connected child. Any outstanding
responses from the children will be indicated as unexpected and may result in
script failure.

STRICT
------

This turns strict mode on and off. It is only effective in interractive mode
and will make interractive mode function like scripted mode where child
responses are only processed after EXPECT, }, OK, or GRANTED commands.

FATAL
-----

This turns fatal mode on and off. When fatal mode is on, any error will cause
ml_master to exit (after issuing a QUIT command) and indicate script failure.

SLEEP
-----

This inserts a delay into a script where no responses are expected. In fatal
mode, any response received during this time will cause failure.

name
----

The "default" command is to send a command to the named child. Note that the
master does not block waiting for a response to one of these commands.

EXPECT
------

This command waits for a child response and compares it to the results expected.
An "*" may be used to indicate don't care for any parameters (for numeric
parameters, -1 has the same effect). If any of the parameters in the response
don't match, an error will be reported (and failure in fatal mode).

OK, AVAILABLE, GRANTED, DENIED, and DEADLOCK
--------------------------------------------

These commands issue a command to the named child and expect the appropriate
response. These commands will block awaiting a response.

OK is only valid for the following commands: OPEN, CLOSE, SEEK, READ,
WRITE, COMMENT, ALARM, HELLO, and QUIT. READ must specify the expected string,
and the length of that string is sent to the child as the expected length. OPEN
accepts any file_number.

GRANTED is only valid with LOCK, and UNLOCK. 

AVAILABLE is only valid for TEST and LIST. For LIST, an empty list is expected.

DENIED is only valid with LOCK.

DEADLOCK is only valus with LOCKW.

CHILDREN
--------

This command creates a list of EXPECT {name} * HELLO OK {name} for each child
named on the command.

{ and }
-------

These paired commands are used to group a set of EXPECT commands where the
responses might arrive in any order. All responses are required for completion
of this command. There is no restriction to what commands may be included
inside a pair of braces, however, note that all OK and GRANTED commands
will immediately block waiting for a response.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR ml_master
----------------------------------

ml_master uses select to wait for input from all the children (and the console
in interractive mode).

ml_master will respond to SIGINT (ctrl-c) and SIGTERM by cleanly exiting. These
should be able to interrupt most hung scripts for a clean exit and failure.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR ml_posix_child
---------------------------------------

ml_posix_child is single threaded and if a command (primarily LOCKW) blocks,
the child will not receive new commands or respond to the master.

ml_posix_child uses ALARM and SIGALRM to interrupt a blocked lock.

THOUGHTS ON POSSIBLE OTHER CHILD IMPLEMENTATIONS
------------------------------------------------

Note that all the parsing and response formatting functions are implemented in
functions.c and separated from the implementation of commands in
ml_posix_child.c. This would make it easy to implement a child that could, for
example, send NFS v3 and NLM requests corresponding to the commands.

Such a child should have a command line option to specify the server's address
and path for initial MOUNT.

An OPEN command would do a LOOKUP (if the asumption was scripts that utilized
files in a single directory, the LOOKUP implementation would not have to deal
with path walking.

Such a child of course need not actually block for a LOCKW command, allowing
the same lock owner to have multiple blocking locks outstanding.

A FEW NOTES ON THE FUNCTIONS IN ml_functions.c
----------------------------------------------

char * parse_response(char * line, response_t * resp);

This function is used by the master to parse out a response. Then use

int compare_responses(response_t * expected, response_t * received);

to verify that response against an expected response (using parse_response
to parse the EXPECT command also).

void add_response(response_t * resp, response_t ** list);
response_t * check_expected_responses(response_t *expected_responses, response_t * child_resp);

These functions implement checking against a list of responses (used by {...})

char * parse_request(char * line, response_t * req, int no_tag);

This would be the center of an alternate child implementation since it will
parse the command stream. ml_master also uses this to syntax check commands and
the built request is also used as the basis of the expected response for OK and
GRANTED.

void respond(response_t * resp);

This function is used by a child to send a response to the output stream
(console in interractive mode and master socket in master mode).

void send_cmd(response_t * req);

This function is used by the master to send commands to children.
